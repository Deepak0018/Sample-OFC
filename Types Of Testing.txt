2. Shakeout Testing - It is done to make sure that applications under test is ready enough to start with the actual Functional/Regression test. Some of the validations are 1.APIs pointing to correct config urls of downstream/Upstream systems, end to end Application flow.

3. Functional Testing – It is to make sure the newly implemented features/functionality of an Application is working as expected as per the User Story/Requirements. 

4. Regression testing – It is a type of testing that is done to verify that a code change in the software does not impact the existing functionality of the product.

5. Performance testing - The focus of Performance Testing is to check a 
•	Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly
•	Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.
•	Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads

6. User Acceptance Testing – User Acceptance Testing  is conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or functionality of an application met in the end user perspective.

7. Sandbox Testing: Sandbox testing is nothing but a basic test done in sandbox clusters(Similar to Prod cluster) to make sure everything is fine just before the code being pushed to Production Clusters.
P7 and P12

8. Production Validation/Testing : A basic test to make sure the application functionality is working fine in the production Clusters. 
P1,P2,P3,P11,P23.
